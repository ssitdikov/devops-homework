# What is about connection

Magic script for getting information by connections.

You can use script:
- step by step
- by parametrization (_coming soon_)

For running step by step you must run script without parameters for filtering and fetching num of rows:
```shell
./whocn.sh
```
It calls navigation menu for setting PID or/and name of process, result of rows or run with default parameters  
```shell
1) Set up PID of process
2) Set up name of process
3) Set up max result rows
0) Run
```
